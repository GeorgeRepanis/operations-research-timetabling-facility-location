# operations-research-timetabling-facility-location


Two Optimization models in Python with PuLP: (1) a high-school timetable built via Binary Integer Linear Programming with constraints on required weekly hours, one class per slot, teacher absences, and special rules (e.g., PE only on Thursday 14:00â€“16:00), exporting the final schedules to `programma_teliko_final_output.xlsx`.  (2) a Capacitated Facility Location model selecting which warehouses to open and how to route flows to 12 sales centers to minimize fixed + transport costs, with results summarized in `Analysis_Cost_Final.xlsx` and a NetworkX flow diagram.
